This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r demo_plot}
plot(cars)
```


```{r preface}
# package installs have been commented out. 
# if you already have installed, don't re-install for no reason!
# install.packages("tidyverse")
# install.packages("gapminder")
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r load_gapminder_data}
gapminder_table <- gapminder
gapminder_table
summary(gapminder_table)

```


```{r spread_by_year}
#spread_by_year
year_spread <- gapminder_table %>% 
    filter(year > 1951) %>% 
    filter(country == "Afghanistan" | country == "Ireland") %>% 
    select(country, year, lifeExp) %>% 
    spread(year, lifeExp)
year_spread
```


```{r gather_by_year}
year_spread %>% 
    gather(year, lifeExp, "1952":"2007")
#year_gather
```




Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
